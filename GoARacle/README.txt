GoARacle by CrescentRR

This is a program made to read KH2FM seed files (pnach) and give you hints for your runs.

				How to use:

-Press the "Select Seed" button, then path to the location of your seed.  Navigate to your seed (pnach) file and confirm your choice.

-When you collect a report (or the GoA map if you want to use it), click on the respective report to get a quiz on the location of it.

-Answer the quiz correctly to see the hint.  


				"How do I read the hints?"

-Each report hint shares a format: [Pool] [Location] [Remaining Priority Score]/[Total Priority Score]

-The Pool it refers to is the pool with the highest Priority Score total in that world. (See "What is Priority Score" for more information)

-The Location is where the report is referring to.  

-Remaining Priority Score is the amount of Priority Score left in the world that you haven't marked off (See "How do I check things off?" for more information)

-Total Priority Score is the total of the Priority Score of all the items in that world.

-If you cannot see a hint, try resizing the window.


				"I can't seem to remember what each pool contains!"

-Each pool is thematic to make it easier what is in what pool.

-You can read what each pool contains in either the "About" button or by hovering over a pool in the Checklist box.

-PATH OF LIGHT: Think of "Way of the Hero" from ZOoTR.  All required items to complete the run.

-GOOFY'S CHOICE: You use Goofy for Valor, and he's your guardian.  Valor Form and the defensive spells (Cure, Reflect, Magnet)

-DONALD'S CHOICE: You use Donald for Wisdom, and he's your mage.  Wisdom Form and the offensive spells (Fire, Blizzard, Thunder)

-MERLIN'S CHOICE: You got summons from his house in KH1, and he holds the 100 Acre Wood book.  Torn Pages and all Summons

-ROXAS' CHOICE: He's a bit of a novice fighter, but has great strength.  Both Final Form and Light and Dark with generally good things for combat.

-RIKU'S CHOICE: He's a grounded fighter, makes sense for his name.  Limit Form and ground combat tools.

-KAIRI'S CHOICE: She's an air fighter, able to float in the breeze.  Master Form and air combat tools.

-MICKEY'S CHOICE: Honestly the hardest pool to remember.  Trinity Limit, Negative Combo, and the elemental magic boosts.

-REPORTS/DiZ: What it says on the tin.  Secret Ansem's Reports 1-13 with the Garden of Assemblage Map.


			"What is Priority Score?":

-If you press the "About" button, it shows you all the items the generator considers "important".  Each pool has a respective "Priority Score"

-Items have the same priority score as the pool that contains them.  

-For example, the Promise Charm, which is in the Path of Light pool, is worth 100 Priority Score.

-Each world's Priority Score is determined by the total score of items within it.  


			"How do I check things off?"

-Press the "Mark Off" button to bring up a box for what location you want to mark off.

-Select your world and you will be presented with a new window.

-The top-left menu is to switch the current location with another, in case you are done with a world for the time being.

-The top-right text is the amount of points you found in that world currently.

-The main part of the window are your checklists.

-Each one has a label and a spinner (the box with the number and the arrows)
	
-If you hover over the label, it shows you the items in that pool and their priority score.

-If you press up on the spinners, it increments the inner value by 1, and adds the value of that pool's items to the Points text, and if the world is featured in a report, it would also update that.
