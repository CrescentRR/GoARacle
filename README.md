# GoARacle
Garden of Assemblage Randomizer Oracle.  Generates hints for runs.

## Plans

-Create executable file.  Please if you know how to make one with all of the files please let me know.


## Changelog

8/20/20 8:15pm EST: Fixed sorting.  Now counts reports in priority score count.  Visible priority score for a rough estimate of what is in each world/for testing.  About button now shows reports and priority score (PC) next to each pool.  

8/20/20: Completed usable demo of hint generator.  Not an executable, but it still should run without needing to fix code.  

## Special Thanks

Thanks to jsmartee for being such a great guy and amazing wall for me to bounce design decisions off of. I wish him the best.
If you haven't checked out his hint generator a la Spikevegeta's design, you can get it here: https://github.com/Jsmartee/kh2fm-hints-demo

Thanks to Valaxor for the input during initial thoughts, without it there would be quite a lot of backtracking, but now I have a better idea of what I want to do.
Val's the amazing creator of the seed generator site!  Check it out here: https://randomizer.valaxor.com/#/seed
