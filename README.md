# GoARacle
Garden of Assemblage Randomizer Oracle.  Generates hints for runs.

## Plans

-Create executable file.  Please if you know how to make one with all of the files please let me know.

## Changelog

8/23/20: Created a Google Sheets spreadsheet for recording your findings.  Makes it easier to track the current score of items you have, giving you a better idea of how much there still is to find.  You can find it here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRdCDJb4bGSOApkjolcLxP5RfyjV2Gn_DfR7Aoo56ZY/edit?usp=sharing and in the application folder, called "GoARacle Item Checklist" as a shortcut.

8/22/20: Added anti-cheat.  When clicking on a report button, brings up a box to check where that report was.  If answered correctly, replaces the button with the hint.  If answered incorrectly, nothing happens.  Trying to brute force it is not really worth it, though possible.  Might be something to look at, if people ask for it.

8/20/20 8:15pm EST: Fixed sorting.  Now counts reports in priority score count.  Visible priority score for a rough estimate of what is in each world/for testing.  About button now shows reports and priority score (PC) next to each pool.  

8/20/20: Completed usable demo of hint generator.  Not an executable, but it still should run without needing to fix code.  

## Special Thanks

Thanks to jsmartee for being such a great guy and amazing wall for me to bounce design decisions off of. I wish him the best.
If you haven't checked out his hint generator a la Spikevegeta's design, you can get it here: https://github.com/Jsmartee/kh2fm-hints-demo
And use it here: https://jsmartee.github.io/kh2fm-hints-demo/

Thanks to Valaxor for the input during initial thoughts, without it there would be quite a lot of backtracking, but now I have a better idea of what I want to do.
Val's the amazing creator of the seed generator site!  Check it out here: https://randomizer.valaxor.com/#/seed
