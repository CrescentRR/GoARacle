## Special Thanks

Thanks to jsmartee for being such a great guy and amazing wall for me to bounce design decisions off of. I wish him the best.
If you haven't checked out his hint generator a la Spikevegeta's design, you can get it here: https://github.com/Jsmartee/kh2fm-hints-demo

Thanks to Valaxor for the input during initial thoughts, without it there would be quite a lot of backtracking, but now I have a better idea of what I want to do.
