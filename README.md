Garden of Assemblage Randomizer Oracle.  Generates hints for runs.

## Plans

-General bugfixes

-Balance changes with help of feedback

-Create executable file.  Please if you know how to make one with all of the files please let me know.

## Changelog

8/23/20 10:34pm EST: Selecting the pnach file now starts at the Desktop instead of within the file's directory.  Made it so pools with equal priority score would randomize which one would show up.  Changed text in the About page that incorrectly stated that Kairi's pool contained Negative Combo, when it actually contains Berserk Charge.  Changed the units from "PC" to "Priority Score" to more accurately represent what it means.  

8/23/20 9:45pm EST: Added 3 strikes for anti-cheat to discourage brute-forcing.  Fixed being able to interact with report buttons after passing the check OR failing the test multiple times.

8/23/20: Created a Google Sheets spreadsheet for recording your findings.  Makes it easier to track the current score of items you have, giving you a better idea of how much there still is to find.  You can find it here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRdCDJb4bGSOApkjolcLxP5RfyjV2Gn_DfR7Aoo56ZY/edit?usp=sharing and in the application folder, called "GoARacle Item Checklist" as a shortcut.

8/22/20: Added anti-cheat.  When clicking on a report button, brings up a box to check where that report was.  If answered correctly, replaces the button with the hint.  If answered incorrectly, nothing happens.  Trying to brute force it is not really worth it, though possible.  Might be something to look at, if people ask for it.

8/20/20 8:15pm EST: Fixed sorting.  Now counts reports in priority score count.  Visible priority score for a rough estimate of what is in each world/for testing.  About button now shows reports and priority score (PC) next to each pool.  

8/20/20: Completed usable demo of hint generator.  Not an executable, but it still should run without needing to fix code.  

## Special Thanks

Thanks to jsmartee for being such a great guy and amazing wall for me to bounce design decisions off of. I wish him the best.
If you haven't checked out his hint generator a la Spikevegeta's design, you can get it here: https://github.com/Jsmartee/kh2fm-hints-demo
And use it here: https://jsmartee.github.io/kh2fm-hints-demo/

Thanks to Valaxor for the input during initial thoughts, without it there would be quite a lot of backtracking, but now I have a better idea of what I want to do.
Val's the amazing creator of the seed generator site!  Check it out here: https://randomizer.valaxor.com/#/seed

Thanks to "Key (Shrug)" on Discord for his input and feedback on the generator during designing.  Always appreciated, and good luck on your races.
